# crud-routing-project
This is my first personal practical hands on code project of react. It contains react CRUD operation, Routing, JSON Server, Images upload, and finally, filtering.

The project will have different parts:
1. A routing system that can navigate in different pages.
2. An internal navigation system. Something like a dashboard system. A page that will display in a table the saved data in a table.
3. Page loader
4. Home or General page that displays all data + a search system.
4. A Saving form, response messages
5. View form
6. An update page

The system will at first record 4 data entries.
